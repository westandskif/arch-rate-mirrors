# 0.17.0 (XXXX-XX-XX)

- switched Manjaro to use https://mirror-manager.manjaro.org/status.json
  instead of https://repo.manjaro.org/status.json
- started to return non-zero code when there are no mirrors left after
  pre-filtering

# 0.16.4 (2023-07-28)

- changed rebornos mirrorlist url[#49 by SoulHarsh007](https://github.com/westandskif/rate-mirrors/pull/49)

# 0.16.3 (2023-07-26)

- changed artix mirrorlist url [#48 by marcuscastelo](https://github.com/westandskif/rate-mirrors/pull/48)

# 0.16.2 (2023-07-17)

- reverted `--save` (base), `--version-mirror-concurrency` (endeavouros),
  `--separator` (stdin) option name

# 0.16.1 (2023-07-17)

- reverted `--eps-checks` default to 40 (back to strict threshold on early
  speed test exit in cases where speed is stable)
- fixed `--version` option

# 0.16.0 (2023-07-16)

- added environment variables support, see e.g. `rate-mirrors --help` and
  `rate-mirrors arch --help` for details
- softened the threshold, when the tool considers that country jumping yielded
  too few results and falls back to testing all the mirrors
- increased `--concurrency` default to 16. Better support for fast connections.
- increased `--per-mirror-timeout` default to 8000ms. Better support for slow
  connections.
- added new option: `--max-per-mirror` - maximum downloading time, required to
  measure mirror speed, in milliseconds, default is 1000ms. This limit speeds
  up tests as there's not much sense in download times more than 1000ms to get
  a sense of a mirror speed.

# 0.15.3 (2023-07-09)

- switched to rust stable
- updated dependencies

# 0.15.2 (2023-06-28)

- changed `max-delay` type to signed int because
  `https://archlinux.org/mirrors/status/json/` replied with `"delay": -7`

# 0.15.1 (2023-05-23)

- fixed mirrors url for artix [#42 by Giga-Bowser](https://github.com/westandskif/rate-mirrors/pull/42)
- changed arch, archarm and manjaro to use "extra.files" instead of
  "community.files" for speed testing by default

# 0.15.0 (2023-02-12)

 - added `--disable-comments-in-file` so when `save` option is used, it no
   longer prints comments to it, e.g.: `rate-mirrors --disable-comments-in-file --save abc.txt artix`
   [#38 by ErenKarakas1](https://github.com/westandskif/rate-mirrors/pull/38)

# 0.14.0 (2023-01-27)

 - added fallback to untested mirrors in case if all tests fail [#36 by vnepogodin](https://github.com/westandskif/rate-mirrors/pull/36)
 - updated dependencies

# 0.13.0 (2023-01-26)

 - added support of Archlinux Chinese community mirrors - `archlinuxcn` [#35 by teppyboy](https://github.com/westandskif/rate-mirrors/pull/35)

# 0.12.0 (2023-01-26)

 - added Archlinux Chaotic-AUR mirrors support - `chaotic-aur` [#34 by teppyboy](https://github.com/westandskif/rate-mirrors/pull/34)

# 0.11.1 (2022-08-30)

 - fixed `archarm` output

# 0.11.0 (2022-08-15)

- added Archlinux ARM support - [#30](https://github.com/westandskif/rate-mirrors/pull/30)
- added `--concurrency-for-unlabeled` option (default: 40) to speed up cases
  when country hopping yields too few results and we have to fall back to
  testing the remainder. The remainder may contain tens or hundreds of mirrors,
  so it makes sense to have separate default concurrency for unlabeled mirrors
  (ones without country). This should not worsen results too much because
  there's still `--top-mirrors-number-to-retest` (default: 5) with `1`
  concurrency.

# 0.4.0 (2021-06-24) -- BREAKING CHANGES

- **! BREAKING CHANGE !** now the tool is named "rate mirrors"
- **! BREAKING CHANGE !** now there are three subcommands for three different modes:

  - arch
  - manjaro
  - stdin

  See the readme for details.

  Configuration options are also split into common ones (which go before
  subcommand) and mode-specific ones (which go after)

- Added `--allow-root` option to run as root

# 0.3.0 (2021-05-20)

- Added `--save` option to write output to file
- Now it fails when run as root

# 0.2.1 (2021-02-22)

- Enabled _vendored_ feature for `openssl-sys` crate to allow for musl builds

# 0.2.0 (2021-02-21)

- Added `--sort-mirrors-by` option to control how mirrors are initially sorted
  within the country, `score_asc` by default. The full list of options is:
  _score_asc, score_desc, delay_asc, delay_desc, random_

- Added `--protocol` option to control acceptable protocols `https`, `http`. Both
  both are enabled by default. Rsync not supported.

# 0.1.0 (2021-01-17)

Initial.
